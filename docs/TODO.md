## Handle non-printable characters better

This is applicable when non-printable characters are in the SSID column, or perhaps the AP NAME column when `--ap-names` is used:

## Implement ~~VHT~~ Tx Power Envelope Parser

This element is not specific to VHT. It is also found in HE in 6 GHz.

- [X] Added in 85517b8461c32704e925b020d7c2878228dd3cad

## Leverage memoryview for interactions with bytes

Use memoryview slicing instead of bytes slicing. This should speed up the profiling of IEs. Move this into a design document?

<https://effectivepython.com/2019/10/22/memoryview-bytearray-zero-copy-interactions>

## pwnagotchia

Consider trying to add support for detecting pwnagotchias nearby.

- uses `de:ad:be:ef:de:ad` - could possible decode the data thrown into the IE to
- [ ] determine if it has connected to a pwngrid
- [ ] show stats for when they show up
- [ ] could suggest enabling 802.11w

## Passpoint and Hotspot 2.0 detection

- [ ] Add detection for Passpoint networks (.11u)?
- [ ] <https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/specifications>

## Minimum Requirements and Tested Versions

- [X] Python 3.7 and above only at this point.

Tested versions:

- [X] Python 3.7.x  
- [X] Python 3.8 (tested 3.8b1 week 7/1/2019)
- [X] Python 3.9 (tested January 2021)
- [X] Python 3.10rc2 (tested September 2021)

## Writing to the screen w/ multiple adapters

- [X] Move the write to screen code out of the `Client` Object. DONE 6/25
- [X] Cache the results. DONE 6/25
- [X] Fire up an event in the client, when the data is stored. After you receive all the events, from all clients/adapters, then you write to screen. DONE 6/25
- [X] Screen output is always the last step and should be isolated from the rest. DONE 6/25
- [ ] Clean up and test all params w/ multiple adapters
- [ ] Write unit tests

## Notification for duplicate MACs

- [X] Alert users when there are duplicate BSSIDs in the scan results.
- [ ] Write unit test for this to verify this is done right.

## sorting, filtering and counters

- [X] Sort output by RSSI
- [ ] Add ability to sort by different columns?
- [X] Options to filter by PHY. We're now able to sort by 5 GHz with `-a`, 2.4 GHz with `-g`, and 6 GHz with `-six`.
- [ ] Write unit tests for these

## Export or silent mode that can be a feed into another program

- [X] `--json` support has been added

## Detecting Windows Terminal vs cmd.exe and features like unicode support

This may be dependent on what shell on Windows is used. Windows Terminal versus Command Prompt for example.

- [ ] Adding lock symbols for example. This may be complex. Doesn't work with cmd.exe. Does it work with Windows Terminal?
- [ ] Investigate if there is any cool stuff we can do with Windows Terminal
- [ ] Support for UTF-8 encoded SSID names.

## 802.11b

- [ ] HR-DSSS for 5.5 and 11 Mbps, and DSSS for 1 and 2 Mbps - is there a way to display this easily? These both appear to be labeled as ERP on my app.
- [ ] DSSS data encoding uses 22 MHz wide channels. This is because the chips (bits) need 2 MHz of space and there are 11 bits. 802.11b only networks should have the channel width listed as 22 MHz.
- [ ] My HR-DSSS test network seems to be classified as ERP. Why?
- [ ] Parse and display the Capabilities based on bit value.

## Export/Import

- [ ] Handle input and decode of WinFi's `.BSS` files - may have to do this manually.
- [X] Add ability to import / export to .IES and .BSS
- [X] Add ability to import / export .IES and .BSS together into a single file for 1 network or multiple networks.
- [ ] Add ability to export to PCAP.

## Optional/Enhancements

- [ ] Reporting type function or export like function. Splunk?
- [X] BSSID grouping by AP Base MAC (Cisco:XX:XX:X0-F in 2.4 and XF-0 in 5). Partial matching with `-bssid` include filter works today.

## Current connection

- [X] Add flag that only displays current connection info to screen (like `airport -i` on macOS)

## Unit Testing (pytest)

All unit testing should be done with pytest.

First step to capabilities testing is to have some sort of record function for a set of results which can be exported and then imported for testing.

## Detection for other types of networks

- [ ] WiDi/Miracast/WiFi Direct Networks.
- [ ] WPS is IE 221, OUI 00-50-F2 (Microsoft), and Type 4 --- there is device name in this field.

## Potential Improvements for Spatial Stream detection

- [ ] investigate WDI_TLV_INTERFACE_CAPABILITIES usage for supported Rx and Tx spatial streams for a particular interface.
  - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wdi-tlv-interface-capabilities#requirements>
  - UNIT8 - The supported number of RX spatial streams.
  - UNIT8 - The supported number of TX spatial streams.

## Information Elements

- [ ] Calculate min and max rates
- [X] Parse HT Operation
- [X] Show # of spatial streams as a column. (DONE 2019-01-28)
- [X] Parse HT Capabilities
- [ ] Refactor RSN element and catch KeyErrors whenever doing DICT lookups so that prog doesn't crash.
- [X] WEP is showing up with `None` security. This is because a WEP network does not appear to have a RSNE element. Expected. How do we detect WEP? We detect WEP when there is a lack of RSN and the capabilities information privacy bit is set to 1.
- [X] Parse WMM element (microsoft vendor specific).
- [X] Add support for 160 MHz channels (get an AP that does 160 MHz wide channels). This should work for 5 GHz and 6 GHz now.

## AP names

Nick has some information on this blog about this <https://www.nickjvturner.com/ap-name-broadcast-support>.

- [X] Cisco Aironet IE
- [ ] Cisco Meraki (does Meraki have option to include AP name in their beacons?)
- [X] Aruba
- [ ] Aerohive (IE 221, OUI 00:19:77, Subtype: 33) Aerohive is now owned by Extreme
- [ ] Mist
- [ ] Extreme IdentiFi
- [ ] Extreme WiNG
- [ ] Commscope Ruckus (does Ruckus have option to include AP names in their beacons?)

## Documentation

- [ ] Add contribution guidelines and what we need from users to help troubleshoot when there is an issue.
  - Like export of the IES and BSS so that I can analyze them. Or export of the PCAP?
  - Logs? Watchevents? Debug?
- [ ] Review class design and organizing code.
